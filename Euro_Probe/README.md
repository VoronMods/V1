EuroProbe

This is the Euclid Probe moded for EU as the original magnets and hardware are non standard and not obtainable in EU, just in US.

Changed are the magnets to 8mm South and North pole.

All STL's have correct print orientation, only Trident_8mm_ProbeDock.stl needs supports, will change it later and add build in support.

Mounting the top PCB to Afterburner adapter:
- 2x M2x10mm BHCS self taping or M2 heat inserts 

or

- 2x M3 BHCS with modded head to 4.6 OD, self taping or heat inserts (all adapters in STL)

Installing magnets:
- 4x M2x6mm FHCS 
- 4x M2 nuts
